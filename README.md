# Parallel Patterns in Computing

## Introduction  
Parallel patterns in computing are common ways to break down tasks so that multiple things can happen at the same time.
Instead of doing everything one by one, computers can split up the work and finish it faster.
There are different types of parallel patterns, like **task parallelism**, where different tasks run independently, and **data parallelism**, where the same task happens to different pieces of data at the same time. 
These patterns help computers work better, especially with multi-core processors and powerful graphics cards (GPUs).  

These patterns are super useful in things like video editing, gaming, artificial intelligence, and scientific research.
For example, when editing a video, instead of applying effects one by one, parallel processing can apply them to multiple frames at once, making the process much faster. 
Without parallel patterns, tasks like running big simulations or training AI models would take forever.  

Using both CPUs and GPUs together (heterogeneous computing) makes parallel processing even better. 
CPUs are great for handling small, complex tasks, while GPUs are built for crunching a lot of similar calculations quickly.
When they work together, big problems can be solved much faster, like real-time video processing, weather predictions, or training deep learning models.
This teamwork helps computers run heavy tasks more efficiently and saves time.
