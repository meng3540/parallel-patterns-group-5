# Parallel Patterns in Computing

## Introduction 
Parallel patterns in computing are common ways to break down tasks so that multiple things can happen at the same time.
Instead of doing everything one by one, computers can split up the work and finish it faster.
There are different types of parallel patterns, like **task parallelism**, where different tasks run independently, and **data parallelism**, where the same task happens to different pieces of data at the same time. 
These patterns help computers work better, especially with multi-core processors and powerful graphics cards (GPUs).  

These patterns are super useful in things like video editing, gaming, artificial intelligence, and scientific research.
For example, when editing a video, instead of applying effects one by one, parallel processing can apply them to multiple frames at once, making the process much faster. 
Without parallel patterns, tasks like running big simulations or training AI models would take forever.  

Using both CPUs and GPUs together (heterogeneous computing) makes parallel processing even better. 
CPUs are great for handling small, complex tasks, while GPUs are built for crunching a lot of similar calculations quickly.
When they work together, big problems can be solved much faster, like real-time video processing, weather predictions, or training deep learning models.
This teamwork helps computers run heavy tasks more efficiently and saves time.

We as group number 5 are working on 2D Convolution: 

Parallel Computation Pattern: 2D Convolution
2D Convolution is a fundamental computation pattern used in image processing, computer vision, deep learning, and signal processing. It applies a small matrix called a kernel (or filter) over a larger 2D data array (such as an image) to detect features, apply transformations, or extract patterns. The process involves:

Sliding the kernel over the image.
Multiplying the kernel values with the corresponding image pixels.
Summing the results to produce a new pixel value in the output image.
This operation is used for tasks like edge detection, blurring, sharpening, and feature extraction in deep learning models, especially in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Why is 2D Convolution Computationally Expensive?
Performing convolution on large images or datasets requires millions of multiplications and additions. This makes sequential processing on a CPU slow and inefficient.

Every pixel in the image needs to be processed multiple times.
Larger kernels and high-resolution images increase computational load.
Deep learning models use multiple layers of convolutions, further adding to the complexity.
How GPUs Accelerate 2D Convolution
GPUs are highly optimized for 2D convolution because they can process multiple pixels in parallel. This leads to:

Faster computation by executing many operations simultaneously.
Efficient memory access through techniques like tiling and shared memory.
Scalability for handling large datasets and real-time processing.
Real-World Applications of 2D Convolution
Image Processing: Edge detection (Sobel filter), blurring (Gaussian filter), sharpening.
Computer Vision: Object detection, motion tracking, facial recognition.
Deep Learning: CNNs use 2D convolution to analyze and classify images.
Medical Imaging: MRI and CT scan enhancements, noise reduction.
Audio & Signal Processing: Spectrogram analysis, filtering, and pattern recognition.
Optimizing 2D Convolution with Parallel Computing
To further improve performance, advanced techniques are used:

Tiling & Shared Memory: Reduces redundant memory access and increases efficiency.
Parallel Reduction: Speeds up summation for large datasets.
Strided & Dilated Convolutions: Adjusts kernel movement for faster processing.
Conclusion
2D Convolution is a critical operation in modern computing, enabling high-performance AI, image analysis, and real-time data processing. By leveraging parallelism on GPUs, it becomes scalable and efficient, making deep learning and advanced vision systems possible.
