# ðŸ“Š GPU Occupancy Analysis

This section summarizes how each optimization impacts **achieved occupancy**, a key metric in CUDA performance profiling.

## ðŸ”Ž What is Achieved Occupancy?

**Achieved Occupancy** tells us how well the GPU is able to schedule and utilize its resources (like threads, warps, shared memory) to hide memory latency.

- Higher occupancy â†’ better ability to **keep the GPU busy** while waiting on memory.
- Low occupancy can lead to idle GPU cores and slower performance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Achieved Occupancy Results

| Version        | Achieved Occupancy [%] | Active Warps per SM | Theoretical Max [%] |
|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Basic          | 92.90                   | 29.73                | 100                  |
| Constant Mem   | 92.91                   | 29.73                | 100                  |
| Shared + Tiling| 99.10                   | 31.71                | 100                  |

## ðŸ§  Analysis

### âšª Constant Memory with Caching (92.90% â†’ 92.91%)
- **Impact:** Minimal improvement
- **Why:** Moving the filter to constant memory **doesnâ€™t use extra resources** (registers or shared memory).
- Block size and thread scheduling stay the same â†’ no change in how the GPU handles threads.
- Result: Only a **very tiny** improvement in occupancy (basically the same).

### ðŸŸ¢ Shared Memory with Tiling (92.91% â†’ 99.10%)
- **Impact:** **Big increase in occupancy**
- **Why it worked:**
  - Smaller block size (e.g., 8Ã—8 threads) allows **more blocks** to fit on each SM.
  - Minimal shared memory use means no bottlenecks.
  - GPU can schedule **more warps**, better hide memory latency, and keep cores busier.

## âœ… Summary

| Optimization Step              | Occupancy Change | Main Benefit                         |
|-------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Global â†’ Constant Memory      | ~0%              | Faster filter reads (not occupancy)  |
| Constant â†’ Shared + Tiling    | â†‘ ~6%            | More efficient resource usage        |

ðŸ“Œ **Key Insight**: The biggest occupancy gain comes from **reducing resource usage per block** (not just moving data). This allows better scheduling and helps the GPU hide memory latency effectively.
